### Notes
- Buefy is used to make the whole crafting session faster, and as for the grid system itself I personally implemented the multiline feature to display certain amount of cards before the line breaks.
 - Redesigned the card using corner ribbon, grid layout and coupon tags. Added some animations here and there. For some reasons, I just want to experiment a little :)
 - What could be improved? Filter functionality to sort the tags, as for this stage I only assume that users can only search the title/name.
